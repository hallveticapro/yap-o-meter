### Docker Deployment
For self-hosting or production deployment:

```bash
# Pull and run the pre-built image
docker run -p 5000:5000 ghcr.io/hallveticapro/yap-o-meter:main

# Or build locally
git clone https://github.com/hallveticapro/yap-o-meter.git
cd yap-o-meter
docker build -t yap-o-meter .
docker run -p 5000:5000 yap-o-meter

# With custom port (map external port 8080 to internal port set by PORT env var)
docker run -p 8080:8080 -e PORT=8080 ghcr.io/hallveticapro/yap-o-meter:main

# Using Docker Compose
PORT=5000 docker-compose up -d
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured port).

#### Deployment Features
- **Multi-platform builds** (amd64, arm64) via GitHub Actions
- **Automatic tagging** with `latest` and branch names
- **Health checks** built into container
- **Non-root security** with proper signal handling
- **Production optimization** with separate build and runtime stages

## Educational Benefits

- **Engaging Interface**: Fun themes keep students interested in managing noise
- **Self-Regulation**: Encourages students to monitor their own behavior
- **Classroom Management**: Helps teachers maintain appropriate learning environments
- **STEM Integration**: Science and Math themes reinforce subject matter
- **Seasonal Engagement**: Holiday themes maintain year-round interest

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
- **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
- **Tailwind CSS** with shadcn/ui component library
- **Web Audio API** for real-time microphone processing
- **HTML5 Canvas** for smooth 60fps animations

### Backend  
- **Express.js** server with TypeScript
- **PostgreSQL** database with Drizzle ORM
- **Session management** with secure storage
- **RESTful API** design patterns

### Performance Optimizations
- **Canvas emoji caching** for smooth large-scale particle rendering
- **RequestAnimationFrame** for consistent 60fps animations
- **Efficient particle physics** with proper collision detection
- **Memory management** with particle cleanup and recycling

### Deployment & DevOps
- **Docker containerization** with multi-stage builds
- **GitHub Actions** for automated CI/CD
- **Multi-platform support** (amd64, arm64)
- **Production optimizations** with separate dev/prod servers
- **Security hardening** with non-root containers and health checks

### Recent Technical Challenges & Solutions

#### Docker Production Build Issues (August 2025)
**Challenge**: Vite development server caused runtime failures in Docker production builds due to missing dev dependencies.

**Solution**: Created separate production server (`production.ts`) that serves static files without importing Vite, while maintaining development server (`index.ts`) with hot reload for local development.

#### Canvas Performance Optimization
**Challenge**: Rendering 120+ emoji particles at 60fps with dynamic sizing caused significant lag and memory issues.

**Solution**: Implemented canvas-based emoji caching system that pre-renders emojis at different sizes, eliminating repeated drawing operations and enabling smooth animations.

#### Stars Theme Visibility
**Challenge**: Black star particles were nearly invisible against dark space backgrounds, reducing visual impact.

**Solution**: Enhanced space theme with colorful nebula effects, planets with rings, and improved star contrast while maintaining authentic deep space aesthetic.
